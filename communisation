Communisation/revolution is the removal of the barriers set up by capitalism to keep us from the process to communism.
It is the full destruction of capitalist relations, or rather the transformation of humanity's relationship with itself, animals,
and the land into a communalised format. Revolution needn't be such a long drawn out process, but the creatively intelligent
and theoretically/practically sound removal of the following barriers so as to begin the true process of communism.
From a revolutionary network's inception, the fractal of friendship group, collective, cooperative, rhizome, and Will to Organise
must be nurtured into existence and maintained into realisation of the Dual Power. Then we will accelerate and attack capitalism, overthrowing
the military and state networks in order to control their coordination. We will win the war before it begins.
