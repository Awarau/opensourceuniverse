Here we will discuss what we need for energy. 
We will discuss the blueprints for a society which relies only on renewables. 
The sun god Ra, they can provide for us. Tawhiri can help us with the wind turbines. 

But we will obviously need some discussion of how to procure/make solar panels and turbines. 
We will also need to put down all research on the flaws of solar panels and try fix em collectively. 

Also we will need designs for electricity systems through coops and squats (for now)
and into the future, seeing as communization begins now and is an eternal process - future society's living spaces must evolve
out of present-day communally-shared living spaces.
