In this file we discuss on which lines of society to organise. 
Through workplace, through unions, through transnational corporations, through industries,
through friendship, through specific attack surfaces of Capital (energy sector, finance sector, etc.)

Our conclusion is that there's a need to be polymorphic. That is, to adapt specifically to the
changing surface of Capital. That we must ever-cast our eyes onto into the mechanisms of capital
in order to derive its attack surfaces, our attack vectors, and the strategies of attack.
