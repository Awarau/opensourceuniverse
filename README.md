# opensourceuniverse
This is the origin point of the open source universe eternal process. Here we will construct the theory of reality as we wish it to be. Cultural, economical, political, social, technological, artistic. 

Commit your code, designs, ideas, politics, and then back them up with evidence of effectiveness through history or as reflective
of Counter Empire's implemetation of such theory.  

On the website there will soon be a mapping-graphic for easy navigation of world world implementation, based on Google Earth
named "Resistance Heat Map". There, we will be able to evaluate the effectiveness of theory and implementation.
