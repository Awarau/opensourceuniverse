# opensourceuniverse
This is the origin point of the open source universe eternal process. Here we will construct the theory of reality as we wish it to be. Cultural, economical, political, social, technological, artistic. 

Commit your code, designs, ideas, politics, and then back them up with evidence of effectiveness through history or as reflective
of Counter Empire's implemetation of such theory.  

On the website there will soon be a mapping-graphic for easy navigation of world world implementation, based on Google Earth
named "Resistance Heat Map". There, we will be able to evaluate the effectiveness of theory and implementation. 

On the map, as resistance-heat grows, the idea/theory entry is pushed to the top of one particular category of struggle-place. 
A struggle-place category is defined by many factors: Cultural, economical, political, social, technological, artistic.
This is to ensure an ease of dialectical translation between struggles world wide. As capitalism is not a flat surface,
we realise that resistance cannot be an homogenous movement.
